  "course_description": "5.73 covers fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics: wave properties, uncertainty principles, Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and operator and matrix methods. Basic applications of the following are discussed: one-dimensional potentials (harmonic oscillator), three-dimensional centrosymmetric potentials (hydrogen atom), and angular momentum and spin. The course also examines approximation methods: variational principle and perturbation theory.\n",
